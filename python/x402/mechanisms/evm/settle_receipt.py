    validate_receipt runs after a successful receipt (e.g. a Transfer event check): return a
    SettleResponse to fail settlement, or None to accept success. on_success, when set,
    builds the success response from the receipt.

    When pending_store and pending_key are both provided, they key a store that a subsequent
    settle attempt for the same payload (typically the resource server's single automatic
    retry) uses to reconcile against tx_hash instead of re-broadcasting. Only a
    settlement_pending outcome (wait failure/timeout, or an exception while processing a
    confirmed receipt) is recorded — it is the only outcome safe to retry against. Every
    other outcome — success, an invalid hash, a reverted receipt, or an explicit
    validate_receipt rejection — is terminal and clears the entry instead; a reverted
    receipt still has a transaction hash but is not safe to reconcile against indefinitely,
    so it must not be cached until TTL expiry.

    If persisting the pending entry itself fails, a later retry has no record to reconcile
    against — blindly returning settlement_pending would let it re-verify/re-broadcast and
    risk a double-send. That case is downgraded to failed_reason, preserving tx_hash for
    manual reconciliation. A failure to clear the entry is swallowed instead: the settle
    outcome is already correct and must not be masked by a storage hiccup, and a stale entry
    merely lingers until TTL expiry.
